# 340B-Covered-Entity-Data-Integration-Analytics-Dashboard

## Overview
This project streamlines **340B program data ingestion, storage, and analytics** for a hospital by building an **automated data pipeline** from contracted pharmacies to a **Power BI dashboard** for stakeholders.This dashboard provides insights into 340B program savings and financial impact for a hospital. It visualizes claims, costs, savings, utilization rates, and drug-level expenses, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.



## Note: The data used in this dashboard is synthetic and was generated using Python libraries like Pandas and Faker to simulate real-world scenarios.
